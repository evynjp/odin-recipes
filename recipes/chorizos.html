        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Chorizos are a staple of Colombian cuisine.
        My family has been making homemade chorizos since
        before my parents were even alive. This recipe is 
        that of my abuelo, Bernardo. Around Christmas time,
        the family gets together and makes feet upon feet
        of Colombian chorizos. Pairs well with <a href="./aji.html">El Aj√≠ de La Abuela</a>
