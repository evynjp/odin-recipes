        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Ají is Colombian salsa that can be made
            in a variety of ways with various ingredients.
            However, this is the recipe that my abuela stood by.
            It goes great with many Colombian dishes, including <a href="./chorizos.html">Los Chorizos de Barnardo.</a>
            It is one of my favorite salsas ever.
